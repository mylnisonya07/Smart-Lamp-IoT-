This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Pengatur Lampu Otomatis Pada Rumah Cerdas Untuk Lansia Bebasis Internet of Things" project, a smart home automation system designed to provide automatic lighting control for elderly individuals. The system utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create a comfortable and safe living environment for seniors.

The system consists of the following components:

- ESP32 microcontroller board
- LED lamps
- Relay module
- Dimmer module
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor
- Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor
- Expansion board

The project aims to assist elderly individuals in controlling their lighting usage in three modes using the Blynk mobile application: manual, scheduled timer, and automatic sensor-based control. This system is developed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
